<br/><p>This is my home page with implemented pagination logic, a category name search filter, and an image carousel. I used a Bootstrap theme for the layout.\
I have also implemented logic for adding a product to a favorites list, as well as writing comments under each product (available only for logged-in users).\
For logged-in users, I implemented functionality for uploading a profile picture and the ability to contact the developer(s) in case of questions or potential issues with the application.

<p>Additionally, I created an admin dashboard where I display, in a table format, the number of products, the most ordered products, the status of orders, and the number of products in each category, as well as the order history.</p>
